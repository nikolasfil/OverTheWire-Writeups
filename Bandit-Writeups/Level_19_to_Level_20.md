## Level_19_to_Level_20

--------------------------------------



Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary
in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how
to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual
place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
